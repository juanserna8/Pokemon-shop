Pokemon shop is a web application where you can visualize all your favourite prokemons with their abilities, characteristics and price, and decide which of them you would like to count on for your next battles, depending on your budget, preferences and strategies you might have.

## Technologies

This project is based on React Js, Redux and Tailwind CSS.

The data is being fetched from PokeApi, an API which serves over 250,000,000 calls each month!


## Usage

There is a dropdwon menu where you can see the About/Home page, and the "Pokemons" page, which you can also have access by clicking the PokeBall located in the Header.

In that section, you can select the pokemons you wish and you like, based on their characteristics, price, etc.. To see all those details just click one of the pokemons' cards and it will be shown at the top of the page, where you can decide whether you want to add them in your shopping cart or not.

The cart section can be accesed by clicking in the cart icon at the top right corner of the page. In there, you will find all the Pokemons that you had selected, increase or decrease their quantity  and know the total price you are going to pay in case you want them.
